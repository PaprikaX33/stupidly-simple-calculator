# Stupidly Simple Calculator

A simple python program to do basic calcuation from cli !!

#### Overview ####
The program prompts for user entry asking for the type of calculation they would want to execute. A menu will be verbosed for user to freely choose. From there individual instructions such as "Enter 1st no to add" is carried out for the user.
A statement based input feature has been implemented on main.

## Features

Currently planned features:

* Basic Arithmetics
* Integer Arithmetics
* Statement based input
* Equation support (?)
* Unequal support (?)
* Negative/Imaginary support (?)

### Basic Arithmetics

basic arithmetics will support basic floating point operators:
1. **Addition**
2. **Substraction**
3. **Multiplication**
4. **Division**
5. **Power**
6. **Floor Division**
7. **Factorial**

#### Installation ####
* requires python ver 2.7
* cd path to stupidly_simple_calculator
* to run simply type in cli `python calc_main.py`
